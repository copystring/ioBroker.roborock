# AI Agent Rules & Environment Constraints

This file contains critical rules for any AI agent working on this repository.
**READ THIS BEFORE EXECUTING ANY COMMANDS.**

## 1. Environment: Windows PowerShell
The execution environment is **strict Windows PowerShell**.
*   **❌ FORBIDDEN**: Do NOT use `&&` to chain commands (e.g., `git add . && git commit`).
*   **✅ REQUIRED**: Execute commands sequentially in separate tool calls or steps.
    *   Example:
        1. `git add .`
        2. Wait for success.
        3. `git commit -m "..."`

## 2. Dependency Truth
*   **Trust `package.json`**: The versions in `package.json` are the absolute truth. Do not "hallucinate" conflicts based on your training data cutoffs.
*   **Lockfile**: Respect `package-lock.json`.

## 3. Linting Standards
*   **Zero Tolerance**: Code must be 0 Errors / 0 Warnings before committing.
*   **Config Authority**: Follow `eslint.config.mjs` strictly.
