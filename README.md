## Zeo One washer settings

For `roborock.wm.a102`, writable settings are available under `Devices.<DUID>.commands`:

| State | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `sound` | `0` off, `1` on |
| `child_lock` | `0` off, `1` on |
| `cache_washing_preference` | `0` off, `1` on |
| `detergent_level`, `softener_level` | `0` off, `1` low, `2` medium, `3` high |
| `save_program` | JSON configuration for the appliance's app-program shortcut; does not start a cycle |

Write with `ack: false`. The numeric settings mirror device reports. Dosing changes require an idle, shut-down or completed appliance; saving a program requires standby. Device reports confirm writes, with a 10-second deadline. A broker acknowledgement alone does not confirm a setting.

Example for `save_program` (Quick, wash and dry, 40 °C, one rinse, 1400 rpm, medium drying):

```json
{"mode":2,"program":2,"temperatureLevel":3,"rinse":1,"spinLevel":7,"dryingLevel":2}
```

Modes: `1` wash, `2` wash and dry, `3` dry. Temperature levels: `1` cold, `2` 30 °C, `3` 40 °C, `4` 60 °C, `5` 90 °C, `6` 20 °C. Spin levels: `1` off, `2` 400, `3` 600, `4` 800, `5` 1000, `6` 1200, `7` 1400 rpm. Drying levels: `1` low, `2` medium, `3` high.

Only combinations from the original regional AppPlugin charts are accepted. Omitted options use the chart defaults. `deviceStatus.program_options` lists the options after the device's GeneralInfo report. Existing numeric status IDs and named read-only aliases are retained.

These controls are reconstructed from the original AppPlugin and APK; write behaviour still requires confirmation on a real Zeo One.

## Zone cleaning
This feature only works when map creation is enabled in the adapter options. Open the map from the adapter’s web UI tab in the ioBroker admin interface; no manual URL needed.

### Map creation does not work on raspberry pi
- Draw your square meant for cleaning. Roborock supports up to 4 cleaning zones at once.
